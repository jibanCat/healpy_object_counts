# Counting objects on Healpix Grids (Use WISE-2MASS catalogue as an example)
- This notebook was made for pure amateur interets.
- I found this method in this paper [Star-galaxy separation strategies for WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared galaxy catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0156), by András Kovács, and István Szapudi

# Requirements
- lazy as me: [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) + [`healpy`](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- or install separately:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - [`jupyter`](http://jupyter.org/install.html)
  - [`healpy`](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
  - [`astropy`](http://www.astropy.org/)
